# Video

## What are you working on?
You'll want to choose equipment and software that is best for your project. Not all video cameras are the same and it's important to have a basic idea of your project before you start grabbing equipment. The lists below will help you figure out what you need and if it's available. Skip to the [bottom of the page](https://github.com/hsudml/equipment/blob/master/video/video.md#links) if you already know what you're looking for. 

### Interviews
Whether recording yourself or another person, capturing an interview can be trickier than it seems. Interviews require good quality audio - with many videos, the audio is actually more important than the quality of the video itself. The other major consideration is lighting. You can control the light with camera settings and you can clean up your video during editing, but starting off with a good lighting set up is key to capturing your subject. The equipment listed below will help you capture good audio and get good lighting, but you may also want to take some time to learn about setting up your environment by taking the online Getting Started with Video SkillShop. 

* DSLR Cameras
  * Canon T6i
  * Nikon D3200
* Camcorders
  * Canon Vixia HF R700
  * Canon Vixia HF R300
* Logitech c920 HD Pro Webcam
* Rode VideoMic shotgun mic
* Digital Recorders
  * Tascam DR-05
  * Zoom H1
* Lavalier Microphones
  * AudioTechnica (works with DSLRs, camcorders, and digital recorders)
  * Movo PM-10 (works with smartphones and tablets only)
* USB Mics (require laptop or other device with USB port and recording software)
  * Blue Snowball (ICE)
  * Samson C01U 

### Events
Recording a visting speaker, class presentation, or similar event has some other requirements that are different from interviews. Being able to capture the scene will be quite different- whether you want to shoot the entire audience or the presenter and screen will dictate how you select your equipment and set it up. For livestreaming, you will want to consider a webcam or smartphone, whereas for recording only, you have more options (see above). Some special considerations would be: 

* Mic the presenter with the Movo PM-10 lavalier mic and record to a smartphone to get great audio. 
* Use the Logitech c920 HD Pro Webcam to stream high quality audio and video from a computer. 
    * If the built-in mic alone isn't good enough, try also using the Blue Snowball or Samson C01U USB mics. 
* Use the 360fly to capture and stream the entire area. Post your 360-video to YouTube or Facebook and let your audience see everything and get immersed in the event. This will require some preparation and possibly an external mic. Let us know if you are planning this and we can help you get everything just right: dml@humboldt.edu.

### Webconferencing & Video Chat
These types of projects require that the camera you use have streaming capabilities. Many cameras do not. Also, you will likely need a device (laptop, desktop, tablet) with software to run the video chat or conference. Smartphones and tablets with built-in cameras and mics have a variety of apps for videconferencing and if you have one of these, that may be your simplest option. If you need a better quality camera or mic, take a look at the list below: 

* Ligitech c920 HD Pro Webcam - this camera shoots in HD (1080p) and has a pretty good mic for most applications. It can be a good option for streaming live events as well.   
* 360fly 4k - this 360-degree camera can be set up as a webcam via the included USB cable. See the [360fly support page for instructions](https://support.360fly.com/hc/en-us/articles/232287008-How-to-use-your-360fly-4K-as-a-WebCam-on-your-computer).

* USB Mics (require laptop or other device with USB port and recording software)
  * Blue Snowball (see if a Snowball mic is available to borrow)[]
  * Samson C01U ([see if the C01U is available to borrow](https://humboldt-primo.hosted.exlibrisgroup.com/primo-explore/fulldisplay?docid=01CALS_ALMA999441423402909&context=L&vid=01CALS_HUL&search_scope=01CALS&tab=books_csu&lang=en_US))
